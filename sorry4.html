      <h1>I prepared a speech
      (you might hv to double tap to slightly zoom in so u can scroll n read the entire speech idk how androids work sry)</h1>
      <p> so, we both know i suck at apologizing like, im the person who’s still tryin to figure out how to apologize fr bein an absolute shit bag without even realizing it n be like "wait, whoops... my bad?" energy, but let’s be real i kinda need to fix that sooner than later. so, i did what any normal person would do when they realize they’ve made a lifelong mistake... i googled it. yep, i looked up a whole article on how to apologize, and let me tell u, it’s a SOMETHING.
        (also the html page made my spelling and grammar perfect) (im so grateful fr it)
        
        Step 1: Own your mistake so apparently words ain’t enough, i gotta really get it, like feel it in my soul that i messed up. so i sat there for a min like “oh damn, i really am trash huh?” yeh. step 1: accept ur trashness and move on.
        
        Step 2: give up being right so this one hit hard. like, i’m used to being like, “yo, i wasn’t that wrong tho” but nope. NOPE. turns out, the other person’s feelings > my need to be right. so basically, i gotta accept that ur feelings matter more than my ego. wild.
        
        Step 3: use “I” statements i always thought the “sorry YOU feel that way” was the move but nah, that’s just dodging the blame like a lil coward. so now i gotta say, “I’m sorry I hurt your feelings.” yep, the “I” is the hero now, not me deflecting it back to u. cool cool cool.
        
        Step 4: avoid justifying so i can’t just say “it wasn’t that bad tho” or “u misunderstood” or “i was tired” like i usually do. no more of that weak shit. if i messed up, i own it. no excuses.
        
        Step 5: excuses = bad okay, so i can say i didn’t mean to hurt u, but i can’t use that as an out. like yeah, it was an accident, but that’s not enough to fix it. so i gotta show that i see how i hurt u, before i go explaining myself. balance.
        
        Step 6: no buts NO BUTS. u throw in a “but” and ur apology is dead. i learned that the hard way. no more “sorry i snapped, but i was tired” like that’s a thing i’ve said, and it’s honestly trash. so it’s gotta be “sorry i snapped, i was tired, and i regret it.” no “but” allowed.
        
        Step 7: consider their needs ok, so apparently some people want empathy and some want solutions and some wanna hear how bad i messed up in terms of rules and values. so now i gotta guess what’s gonna hit. it’s like a game, but with feelings. i’m stressed.
        
        Step 8: ask for forgiveness apparently i gotta ask for forgiveness now, not just assume u will forgive me, like “yo, can u forgive me tho?” and that’s lowkey terrifying cause what if u say no? pls don’t say no.
        
        Step 9: show empathy this one’s rough, but i gotta be like “i get why that hurt” even if i didn’t get it before. like, i KNOW i hurt you, and i can’t just brush it off anymore. empathy is the key, even if it feels like too much sometimes.
        
        Step 10: write it down so at this point, i’m like, let me just write this all down cause i know i’m gonna mess up in the moment. so now i got a speech ready and i’m tryin to make sure i don’t sound like a robot. also, lowkey, i might just text this to u, but let’s pretend this is face-to-face for now.
        
        and there it is. me tryin to be a grown-up, doin the whole apologize thing properly. it’s a process, but at least i tried, right? pls forgive me, i’m still learning.
